    "description": "Sean Evans breaks down how to play Hot Ones Truth or Dab The Game in the first-ever explainer video for the first-ever play-at-home game! If you haven’t heard by now, the skunkworks over at Hot Ones HQ launched a game version of Truth of Dab that you can play at home (or remotely!) with your friends and family. Fans are always asking how they can do their own Hot Ones challenges at home and sending over creative videos of what they come up with, so the First We Feast crew thought it would be hot and spicy to make a kit to help you play at home. If you want to run the gauntlet and do Hot Ones, you can always pick up all 10 sauces and go to town. But in terms of a game you can play with your friends, Truth or Dab doesn’t require as much research and deep diving, so Hot Ones teamed up with Wilder Toys and Heatonist to make the official Hot Ones Truth or Dab Card Game. And in this video, Sean shows you how to play at home. He goes through all the contents in the game box, which includes 250 question cards and an official mini bottle of The Last Dab (all 2+ million scovilles)! Cameraguy Bill also pops up to show us how to make wings at home. But to really explain to you how the game is played, three Seans sit down to play an epic round that you have to see to believe. Will the Seans answer truthfully or suffer the wrath of The Last Dab?",
